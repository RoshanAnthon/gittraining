There was lot of confusion around ssh key and etc

What is ssh-key
-- its a solution for annoying password, thats it.
-- you create a ssh key and add it to all the servers etc where you need to have password to access. then its easy ( like sudo)
-- once you do ssh add, you can login to the server passwordlessly, onloy once you have to enter ssh passphrase 

how do you generate ssh key?
Simple

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
-- askd do you want to name --- give name only if you want to maintain multiple ssh keys ( useless) or just enter
-- this by default saves it to ~/.ssh/ -- give a passpharase which you can remember
-- then do following everytime to add the ssh 
-- you can get the key in ~/.ssh/is

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" --- for mac
eval `/volume/buildtools/bin/ssh-agent.sh --and-link` --juniper servers
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

now how do you login to other servers:
For example you wnated to access bnbaas server or qnc server by ssh, dont want to enter password everytime
ssh-copy-id pereirar@bnbaasshell2 ( enter password only once) --- this will do following
or
open ~/.ssh/authorised_keys --- in the server and add your pass-key read obove ( local id_rsa.pub

same way the server keys are used to connect to gerrit etc. for that we have to cat the key pub and copy it then add it to the gerrit.


easy, but will confuse a lot
